# Personal development

By creating a better version of yourself on a daily basis, we get better opportunities, interesting challenges and feeling of success.

It is important to get regular feedback how our goals and results fit together.

## Values

### Why values?

Understanding own values allow us make decision easier and focused on long term benefits. Explicitly outlining own values bring confidence in actions.
The way we choose to behave reflects our values. Our values are extensions of ourselves.

**Values -> Vision -> Goals -> Validation -> Requirements -> Actions**

Every action should be mapped to corresponding Requirements, which is mapped to goals (which results could be validated).
Goals mapped to Visions and Values. If action can't be mapped to Values, is it really worth to spend energy for that action?

Values are based on experience. When experience is rewarded, it could forge into new value.
Safe way to address values of other people is empathy. Presenting to someone contrary experience will help them to question their values.
