# Technology radar

Reflect on what technologies are currently used in the project/team.

Could be used for:
- discussions on things that could be removed or adopted,
- interviews, to give overview about used technologies and expectations,
- audit of technological portfolio,
- convince teams to use stable and safe technologies or to encourage try new ones.

This is an easily editable template for drafting or group work.
