# How  to use

Fill Chance (1-100) and Loss(1-100) for every applicable row. 100 Loss means double schedule that doesn't take any risks to the account.

On the right column you will see impact result. Cells with result >15 and >25 will be highlighted in yellow and red color. 
Cells with the biggest result could be used to find Top10 risks. 

Total value at the bottom may help to understand how remaining schedule could be affected (if remaining schedule is 100).
