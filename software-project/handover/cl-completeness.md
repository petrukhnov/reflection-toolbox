# Checklist for handover completeness

Go through this list after one week of finished handover to check if it was successful. If some points can't be
marked, it means that handover is still in progress. Go through it once again after one more week. Always start
with all boxes unchecked.

- [ ] All new members have had clear tasks for past week.
- [ ] No question asked during last week about people/contacts/roles.
- [ ] No past tools were introduced (tools that were used in past, but not mentioned during handover).
- [ ] No old change request appear (that was agreed before handover and never mentioned during).
- [ ] No past communication channels were introduced (channels that were used in past, but not mentioned during handover).
- [ ] All things that were not clear (mentioned earlier) were resolved.
- [ ] All handover time is recorded.
- [ ] Every new member is confident with the project. No? Ask Why.
